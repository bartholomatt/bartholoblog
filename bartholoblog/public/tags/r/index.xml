      <description>Continuing Where we Left OffIn Part One of this series we worked on getting data using the TidyCensus package to recreate the map below from a recent New York Times Story. Now we’re going to actually do the mapping bit.It Floats…kind ofSo this should be pretty straightforward: we’ve got a dataframe with shapefiles called bay_area_housing. It’s got one column with a shapefile of each census tract in the bay area and another with a ratio of dwellings where more than one person resides per room.</description>

      <description>Recreating a VisualizationOne of the many perks of having Data Science skills is being able to interact with statistics and graphs that you see in the news in a much deeper way. This weekend’s New York Times included  an interesting graphic on housing density and overcrowding in the Bay Area:
My goal in this project is to 1) Recreate the original visualization using census data. 2) Build a function to generate similar maps for any region of the country.</description>
