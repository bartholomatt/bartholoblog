I'm a data scientist from Austin, Texas specializing in data visualization in the R programming language, though I also write some Python on the side. 

In my spare time I enjoy rock climbing, playing pool and hanging out with my lovely girlfriend and her dog. 

I'm also currently on the job market. If you're interested, please check out my <a href = 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OZiIQ9NbHL_XlZwRdpZrzz6ZVO62s39QgwkRei0Apt4/edit?usp=sharing'> CV </a> and drop me an <a href = 'mailto:bartholomatt@gmail.com'> email.</a>
